# The_Best_Classifier

This the the capstone project for the Machine Learning with Python course offered by IBM through Coursera. It uses IBM Watson Studio environment.

Problem Statement:
Given a historical dataset of past loans(Loan_train.csv) predict whether a new customer defaults to a loan in time or not.

In this project, 4 different classification techniques were used, namely:

1.K-Nearest Neighbours.

2.Decision Tree.

3.SVM classification.

4.Logistic Regression.

All the above techniques have been applied to the same classification problem and the goal is to determine the best classifier among them in terms of accuracy.

Accuracy measurement was done using:

1.Jaccard similarity index.

2.Log loss.

3.F1-score.
